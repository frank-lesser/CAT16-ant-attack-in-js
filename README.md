This is an atempt to learn how to use THREE.js and getting to play with Ant Attack code once more.

*This will probably not work on your browser*

...it will be slow and painful and horrid, perhaps you'll be lucky and nothing will happen,
thus not locking up your browser, CPU, laptop etc.

There's a whole heap of optimisation to go, mainly building the whole thing into a single mesh
and therefor removing internal faces and joining adjacent faces together. But all in good time.
For now I'm just happy it kind of worked.
